# ðŸ§© Exercise: Choosing Log Levels (INFO vs DEBUG)

In this exercise, decide whether each log line should be logged at **INFO** (for operators) or **DEBUG** (for developers).  
Explain your reasoning.

## Events

1. Application started on port 8080  
2. Fetching order `o123` from the database  
3. Order `o123` processed successfully with status SHIPPED  
4. Calculated tax for order `o123`: subtotal=100.0, taxRate=0.25, tax=25.0  
5. Database connection failed: timeout after 5 seconds  
6. Exception stack trace when processing order `o456`  
7. External API call to PaymentService took 320 ms  
8. Cache cleared automatically after exceeding 10,000 entries

## Suggested Answers (Teacherâ€™s Key)

1. **INFO** â€“ milestone (startup).  
2. **DEBUG** â€“ internal detail (data access).  
3. **INFO** â€“ milestone (business outcome).  
4. **DEBUG** â€“ calculation detail, not needed by operators.  
5. **INFO** or **ERROR** â€“ depending on retry policy; at least visible to operators.  
6. **DEBUG** â€“ full stack trace for developers; operators just need the error message.  
7. **DEBUG** â€“ performance diagnostics.  
8. **INFO** â€“ system health event operators may care about.

âœ… **Rule of thumb:**  
- **INFO** = story for operators (what happened).  
- **DEBUG** = extra detail for developers (how it happened).
